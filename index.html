    <!-- Proposal -->
    <h2>Proposal</h2>

    <div class="proposal_items">
    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <div class="text_indent">
        The goal of our project is to create a model, using supervised classification, that is able to identify and diagnose _______ (cardiomegaly?) from an inputted Chest X-ray. 
        Using our system, someone can input a Chest X-ray of a patient, and our model will predict whether or not the patient has ________ (cardiomegaly?). If the X-ray diagnose
        is positive, the Chest X-ray will be outputted with a rectangle encasing area of interest (the enlarged heart).
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <!-- Approach
    Comments: potentially mention some preprocessing we might do on the X-Rays/what pre-processing we might do to an inputted patient image before our model makes a prediction
    Maybe talk about the steps of the CNN and how it relates to material from class? -->
    <h3>Approach</h3>
    <div class="text_indent"> 
        We will be utilizing supervised learning to detect for features indicative of [our specified diagnosis]. 
        This will be done by training a convolutional neural network to extract features and classify the input X-Ray images, with a certain confidence, 
        into the various classes representing each condition. There will be some overlap between classes due to the nature of the dataset used, 
        but we will choose the class with the highest confidence for a given image with overlapping ground truth.
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <!-- Experiment and Results
    Comments: Mention which software we will be using (TensorFlow and Keras?) and how our work environment will be setup? Not sure if we should just mention Tensor flow for 
    experimental setup or also include stuff like Github and Trello. Mention what we will implement ourselves
    What makes our project successful-->
    <h3>Experiments and Results</h3>
    <div class="text_indent">
        We will be using the NIH Clinical Center's publically available Chest X-Ray dataset. We will be using TensorFlow.... 
        Our project will be successful if we can make a model that can diagnose ______ (cardiomegaly?) based on an input Chest X-ray with a accuracy of ___.
