    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <div class="text_indent">
        Chest X-rays are highly valued in diagnosing injuries and ailments within the 
        thoracic region. However, medical diagnosis of these ailments can prove very 
        challenging. Our team wanted to discover a way to easily diagnose nodules, masses, 
        and cardiomegaly, all of which could be diagnosed more easily with aid from a 
        neural network-backed computer vision system. <br><br>
        
        Masses and nodules are similar in that both growths are tumors; the only 
        variance is that masses are larger in size, usually greater than 3cm in diameter, 
        whereas nodules are smaller, with a width smaller than 3cm. These growths could 
        be categorized as benign or malignant, but malignant growths have a high probability 
        of metastasizing and could be life-threatening if not treated soon. (“Lung Masses and Growth”) <br><br>

        Cardiomegaly can be defined as the enlargement of the heart. Causes of cardiomegaly 
        range from short-term bodily stress to myocardial weakness and arrhythmia. An enlarged 
        heart can be treated through surgery and certain medications and is generally easier 
        to treat when diagnosed earlier. (“Enlarged Heart”) <br><br>

        These three ailments were chosen because of the feasibility of diagnosis given the 
        time constraint of the project. These three are solid ailments in the chest and easy 
        to identify and classify, whereas the other ailments are all some form of liquid in the 
        lungs, making them harder to identify and distinguish from one another. <br><br>

        The goal of our project is to create a model, using supervised classification, that is 
        able to identify and diagnose nodules, masses, and cardiomegaly from an inputted Chest X-ray. 
        A Hough transformation and deformable contour will then be used to locate the position of the 
        ailment specifically within the image. A user of our system will be able to input a Chest X-ray 
        of a patient, and our model will then determine the presence (with a corresponding confidence level) 
        of a nodule, mass, or cardiomegaly. The model will then output the image with a boundary encasing 
        area of interest (the enlarged heart, nodule, or mass) and the estimated size of the nodule/mass.

    <!-- Approach
    Comments: potentially mention some preprocessing we might do on the X-Rays/what pre-processing we might do to an inputted patient image before our model makes a prediction
    Maybe talk about the steps of the CNN and how it relates to material from class? -->
    <h3>Approach</h3>
    <div class="text_indent"> 
        We will be utilizing supervised learning to detect features indicative of a mass, nodule, 
        or cardiomegaly. This will be done by training a convolutional neural network to extract 
        features and classify the input X-ray images, with a certain confidence, into the various 
        classes representing each condition. There will be some overlap between classes due to the 
        nature of the dataset used, but we will choose the class with the highest confidence for 
        a given image with overlapping ground truth.  <br><br>   
        The general architecture of our model will consist of the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Initial pre-processing within the input layer</li>
            <li>CheXNet architecture used as a basis for development of hidden layers
                <ul>
                    <li>Original network has 121 layers - will be narrowed down proportionally to reflect scope of this project</li>
                    <li>Original network was trained on 100,000 frontal chest X-Ray images - aim to narrow this down as well 
                        depending on image choice (uncertain as explained below in the experiment sub-section)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Hough transform after classification for location (except for cardiomegaly detection)</li>
            <li>Deformable contours to define the boundaries of the ailment</li>
        </ul>
        Our approach for locating nodules and masses would be preprocessing the image to remove noise, and then 
        use a generalized Hough transformation (using our PS2 implementation as a basis) to locate the roughly 
        where the nodule or mass might be and then applying a deformable contour to get the more exact boundaries 
        (since the nodules or masses are slightly non-rigid) and potentially calculating the size (area) of the 
        nodule or mass using the boundary. We will use various filters (Sobel, Prewitt, etc.), smoothing techniques, 
        and quantization/clustering to address potential image noise in order to get better results from our 
        detection. We will also use varying ranges of target radii for detecting the nodules and masses as they 
        are going to vary in size, and we can use the results of our contouring to further refine our ranges 
        (by having a better estimate of average size for each ailment).
        <br><br>
        Our approach for locating cardiomegaly would be to evolve a contour to best fit the boundary of the heart 
        in the chest X-ray. Although the heart will be located in roughly the same region across X-ray images 
        (center-right of the image, mostly on the patient’s left side), we may need to perform 2D image transformations 
        to make some outlier X-rays uniform (e.g. X-ray of a small child). The contour would be initialized 
        roughly where the enlarged heart would be expected to be found in the chest X-ray (middle right of the image). 
        The shape of the contour will then iteratively deform to better fit the contours of the heart. Once the 
        contours have converged, then the contour will be extracted from the image and compared against control 
        contours of normal and enlarged heart to double check whether the heart is normal-sized or indeed enlarged.
        <br><br>
        We will be basing the architecture for our network off the CheXNet architecture that has already been built to classify chest X-Rays.

    <!-- Experiment and Results
    Comments: Mention which software we will be using (TensorFlow and Keras?) and how our work environment will be setup? Not sure if we should just mention Tensor flow for 
    experimental setup or also include stuff like Github and Trello. Mention what we will implement ourselves
    What makes our project successful-->
    <h3>Experiments and Results</h3>
    <div class="text_indent">
        We will be using the NIH Clinical Center's publically available Chest X-Ray dataset. The dataset is 
        prelabeled with the associated thoracic pathology (if any) and identified as training data or testing 
        data. The dataset contains 112,120 frontal-view X-ray images, covering 14 different illnesses. Since 
        we are focusing on nodules, masses, and cardiomegaly, we will be using a subset of the 20,584 images 
        that correspond to those illnesses. We will be using TensorFlow and Keras to create a convolutional 
        neural network and train it with the training data and test the accuracy of our model’s predictions 
        with the testing data. As for the Hough transformation and deformable contours, we will implement 
        based on the pseudocode from class and outside of class research. Our project will be successful if 
        we can make a model that can diagnose nodules, masses, and cardiomegaly based on any input Chest 
        X-ray with at least 75% accuracy and denote specifically where the ailments were detected within 
        the X-rays. The measured accuracy will be based on the F1 score metric - a statistical accuracy 
        measure, typically used for binary classification in machine learning. This metric was used by the 
        CheXNet architecture cited earlier in this proposal and has been modified to be comparable for 
        multi-classification problems. Some potential uncertainties would be differentiating between nodules 
        and masses, because of the similarities in the shape of the two ailments, as well as the specific 
        structure of our neural network; we may also find that one architecture works better than another 
        in detecting the relevant illnesses. We will experiment with different neural network architectures 
        on a smaller subset of our dataset images to attain the accuracy of the predictions. We will also 
        experiment with different configurations for our deformable contouring implementation such as 
        changing the number of vertices, the initial shape of the contour, the tension parameter (alpha), 
        and the stiffness parameter (beta). The results of this experiment would help us find the optimal 
        configuration for our purposes. We would also need to test whether using Hough transformations 
        in the labeling of Nodule and Mass locations would be helpful in creating a more accurate model 
        from our architecture. Our hypothesis is that using a hough transformation to pre-process and label 
        the training images as containing an ailment in a certain region (e.g. upper left) before being 
        used in the CNN would lead to a more accurate classification. We will also experiment with using 
        Hough transform and contouring to assist in visualization and labelling after being classified by 
        our model as well as to extract further information from the image such as size (area) of the 
        ailment to determine the severity. Our contouring area and corresponding energy of the area of 
        interest will also be used as a confirmation of the prediction of our model to help prevent 
        false positives.
