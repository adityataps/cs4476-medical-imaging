    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <div class="text_indent">
        Radiologists and physicians manually observe chest X-Rays to diagnose certain illnesses and irregularities.
        Our team is developing a computer vision neural network system to facilitate and validate the diagnosis of chest
        nodules, masses, and cardiomegaly. This will be done through pre-processing of a given X-Ray image, running the
        X-Ray through a convolutional neural network (implemented with TensorFlow) resulting in confidence scores for
        the presence of the considered illnesses, and conducting Hough transform techniques and deformable contouring
        to detect and localize possible masses, nodules, and cardiomegaly. The output of our system is a confidence
        measure (probability) that the detected figure is actually a cardiomegaly or an unusual growth, and the
        location of the growth or cardiomegaly in the image. Our system can then help prioritize images of patients
        with higher confidence measures of a given illness (or ilnesses) and can also recommend further analysis for
        images producing results with high uncertainty.

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <div class="text_indent">
        Chest X-rays are very useful in diagnosing injuries and ailments within the thoracic region. 
        However, medical diagnosis of these ailments can often prove very challenging. Our team is 
        exploring new ways to efficiently diagnose conditions such as nodules, masses, and cardiomegaly.
        Our system will aid in diagnosis using computer vision techniques integrated with a convolutional 
        neural net. <br><br>
        
        Masses and nodules are similar in that both growths are tumors; the only 
        variance is that masses are larger in size, usually greater than 3cm in diameter, 
        whereas nodules are smaller, with a width smaller than 3cm. These growths could 
        be categorized as benign or malignant, but malignant growths have a high probability 
        of metastasizing and could be life-threatening if not treated soon. (“Lung Masses and Growth”) <br><br>

        A cardiomegaly is essentially an enlargement of the heart and is primarily caused by short-term 
        stresses on the body such as pregnancies or underlying medical conditions like heart valve problems 
        and arrhythmias. Like most conditions, cardiomegaly can be treated if diagnosed early enough, which 
        is usually done through treatment and correcting the cause of cardiomegaly; treatments include 
        medications and surgery. <br><br>

        These three ailments were chosen because of the feasibility of diagnosis given the 
        time constraint of the project. These three are solid ailments in the chest and easy 
        to identify and classify, whereas the other ailments are all some form of liquid in the 
        lungs, making them harder to identify and distinguish from one another. <br><br>

        The goal of our project is to create a model, using supervised classification, that is 
        able to identify and diagnose nodules, masses, and cardiomegaly from an inputted Chest X-ray. 
        A Hough transformation and deformable contour will then be used to locate the position of the 
        ailment specifically within the image. A user of our system will be able to input a Chest X-ray of a patient, 
        and our model will then determine the presence (with a corresponding confidence level) of a 
        nodule, mass, or cardiomegaly. The model will then output the image with a 
        boundary encasing area of interest (the enlarged heart, nodule, or mass) 
        and the estimated size of the nodule/mass.

    <h3>Approach</h3>
    <div class="text_indent">
        <div class="image_container">
            <img src="Images\overview_flowchart.png" alt="overview_flowchart">
            <br><br>
            A high-level overview of our approach can be seen in the above figure which will be explained in detail in the rest of this section.
        </div>

        <h4>Preprocessing</h4>
        The first step in our process was to pre-process the input X-ray images to aid the neural network in identifying each of our three main 
        ailments as facilitating post-processing. In deciding on what preprocessing to apply to the chest X-rays, our group considered both HSV 
        and RGB quantization through the use of K-Means clustering. We wanted to quantize the input images in order to reduce the number of 
        distinct colors in each X-ray to make diagnosing for cardiomegaly, masses, and nodules easier. 
        <br><br>

        Each condition involves a solid mass in the body, much more visible and distinct in an X-ray than features in conditions such as infiltration 
        or pneumonia. Upon trying HSV quantization, we realized that, due to the nature of X-ray images, the output quantizations of the images were 
        insufficient. An illustration of this can be found in Figure 1 in the Qualitative Results section. Therefore, we resolved to utilize RGB 
        quantization; however, we had to then test different amounts of clusters to quantize with. Starting at 2 clusters, we could tell that the 
        X-rays were being over-simplified and turning into binary images, losing too much information about the contents of the X-ray. 7 clusters were 
        far too many, as the images were still noisy from the patient’s ribs and other tissues and organs in the chest cavity. With this range in mind, we 
        tested cluster sizes of 3 and 4, and finally settled on 3. Choosing 3 clusters kept enough of the X-ray information to where a mass, nodule, 
        or cardiomegaly could still be identified, but abstracted the X-ray enough to get rid of any noise in the image, like the ribs. Examples of 
        each cluster value can be seen in the Qualitative Results section, in Figure 2.
        <br><br>

        After conducting the RGB quantization on all input images, each image was then convoluted with a box linear filter to produce a smoother 
        pre-processing output to facilitate feature recognition during reinforcement learning.

        <h4>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Reinforcement Learning</h4>
        The original CheXNet architecture was analyzed, having been built using Keras/TensorFlow. The 121-layer neural network was deemed too 
        complex for the scope of this project, and hence, simplifications were made. These include:
        <ul>
            <li>Removal of certain disease/problem categories (Atelectasis, Consolidation, Edema, Effusion, Emphysema, Fibrosis, Hernia, Infiltration, 
                Pleural Thickening, Pneumonia and Pneumothorax were all removed) - categories that were left were cardiomegaly, mass and nodule.</li>
            <li>Training has been done on a smaller subset of the original training set to simplify computation. However, accuracy has not been compromised 
                to a great degree, due to the usage of pre-processed images in training epoch 1 as will be discussed further.</li>
            <li>Testing was only (so far) done on a far smaller subset of randomly sampled (seeded) images from the testing dataset.</li>
            <li>The architecture was simplified by removing a large percentage of the layers (from 121 originally to 60) to make the training, testing and 
                running of the model more computationally easy and efficient given our limited resources.</li>
            <li>Application of the algorithm was done to a set of images that are provided within the NIH chest X-Ray dataset, used by various models for 
                algorithm application (not within either the subset of training or testing)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Post-processing</h4>
        After running our input X-ray through our CNN, we decided to run a Hough transform, a feature-extracting technique utilizing a vote-accumulating 
        matrix, for nodule and mass detection, and deformable contouring, another feature-extraction method using a general shape as an initial contour 
        that then deforms to fit the shape of a feature in the image, to detect for nodules, masses, and cardiomegaly.
        <br><br>

        For the Hough transform used to locate the nodule and masses in the X-rays, we first tried using a modified version of our Hough transformation 
        problem set (PS2) with binning that grouped horizontally by 5 pixels and vertically by 10 pixels. This binning worked the best on masses and it 
        ran faster than our generalized Hough transformation we created afterwards. The modified Hough transformation with bins did not work very well 
        on nodules as there were often small details and noise in the X-ray images that led to misidentification (the same happened with identifying 
        masses, but to a lesser extent). A workaround for this was to choose the region containing the most centers as the region with the mass/nodule. 
        So, if the bottom left contained 5 centers above the threshold, while the other regions contain around 2 - 3 centers, the inputted X-ray would 
        be labeled as having a nodule or mass, depending on the identification, most likely in the bottom left region. This worked decently well for 
        labeling X-rays of nodules and masses with regions, but identification of their specific location was still not very accurate. The next step was 
        to create a generalized Hough transformation that used an R-table created based on an input image of a mass or nodule to perform a general Hough 
        transformation. The generalized Hough transformation worked by creating an R-table based on a reference image which is a cropped sample X-ray 
        of either a mass or nodule taken from some other patient. In the future, we plan on making our own reference image that might be more consistent. 
        The R-table is used to create an accumulator array for the canny edge image of the input image which takes a very long time considering the 
        number of values in the R-table. The generalized Hough transformation worked with a much greater accuracy, and often the mass or nodule would be 
        within the top 5 predicted centers. The downside to using the general Hough transformation is that the process takes a long time to run. 
        Even with vectorization, optimization, and using a smaller less accurate reference image, the generalized Hough transformation can take up to 2 
        minutes to run, making it not feasible for quickly labeling or identifying the location of masses/nodules. Going forward we are trying to find 
        ways of optimizing through possibly decreasing the search space by making bounding boxes around the lungs (which we think could be done via a HOG 
        because of the bones’ strong contrast with the rest of the X-ray) and making the reference image more concise. Creating a bounding box limiting 
        the search to the lungs would also make our results more accurate (and could maybe even help with finding the center where the heart would be 
        located which would be useful for the deformable contour on patients with irregularly shaped X-rays.
        <br><br>

        The deformable contouring works well on cardiomegaly since the starting position does not vary much for the heart. For the heart, the starting 
        position is slightly to the left side of the patient’s chest’s center (skewed right on the X-ray). There are some X-rays that are unusually 
        oriented, so that the patient's body is not centered (as mentioned we might use bounding boxes to help solve this problem).  The starting radius 
        of the circle is 200 pixels. Going forward we can change the initial shape of the contour to make it more irregular instead of a circle so that it 
        fits the shape of a heart better; this would lead to a more accurate contour that would circle around the heart. For the specific implementation, it 
        was based on the class lecture and a technical report by D.N Davis. There are 400 points total in the contour. The alpha is .01 and beta is 2, 
        gamma is 300, and we found that with 150 iterations, the contour reaches a point where it no longer changes. Using a number of iterations higher 
        than this (200 iterations or greater) will lead to x-rays of normal hearts having a different contour with a smaller area, since their contour will 
        continue to decrease in size more after 150 iterations. Each iteration, the 400 points move to minimize the energy function which is based on alpha, 
        beta, and gamma.

    <h3>Experiments and Results</h3>
    <div class="text_indent">
        We will be using the NIH Clinical Center's publically available Chest X-Ray dataset. The dataset is prelabeled with the associated thoracic pathology (if any) 
        and identified as training data or testing data. The dataset contains 112,120 frontal-view X-ray images, covering 14 different illnesses. 
        Since we are focusing on nodules, masses, and cardiomegaly, we will be using a subset of the 20,584 images that correspond to those illnesses. 
        We will be using TensorFlow and Keras to create a convolutional neural network and train it with the training data and test the accuracy of 
        our model’s predictions with the testing data. To carry out this approach, we would require certain resources to train and test our model. 
        For this, we have secured access to a lambdabook (dual GPU deep learning laptop) as well as a certain amount of free Azure credits that 
        can be used to train models on their cloud GPU architecture. This level of computational power should be enough to train the model we have in mind 
        (keeping in mind realistic limitations in complexity of the model as well as number of images pushed). As for the Hough transformation and 
        deformable contours, we will implement based on the pseudocode from class and outside of class research. Our project will be successful if we 
        can make a model that can diagnose nodules, masses, and cardiomegaly based on any input Chest X-ray with at least 75% accuracy and denote 
        specifically where the ailments were detected within the X-rays. The measured accuracy will be based on the F1 score metric - a statistical 
        accuracy measure, typically used for binary classification in machine learning. This metric was used by the CheXNet architecture cited 
        earlier in this proposal and has been modified to be comparable for multi-classification problems. Some potential uncertainties would 
        be differentiating between nodules and masses, because of the similarities in the shape of the two ailments and size being the main 
        differentiating factor, as well as the specific structure of our neural network; we may also find that one architecture works better 
        than another in detecting the relevant illnesses. In addition to different architectures, we might need to try different datasets according to
        the architecture it is being used with (for example, one type of architecture might require a lot of images for training). We will experiment with different 
        neural network architectures on a smaller 
        subset of our dataset images to attain the accuracy of the predictions. We will also experiment with different configurations 
        for our deformable contouring implementation such as changing the number of vertices, the initial shape of the contour, 
        the tension parameter (alpha), and the stiffness parameter (beta). The results of this experiment would help us find the optimal 
        configuration for nodule, masse, and cardiomegaly deformable contours. We would also need to test whether using Hough transformations 
        in the labeling of Nodule and Mass locations would be helpful in creating a more accurate model from our architecture. 
        Our hypothesis is that using a hough transformation to pre-process and label the training images as containing an ailment 
        in a certain region (e.g. Nodule in upper left) before being used in the CNN would lead to more accurate classification. 
        We will also experiment with using different Hough transforms and contouring to assist in visualization and labelling after 
        being classified by our model as well as to extract further information from the image such as size (area) of the ailment to 
        determine the severity. Our contouring area and corresponding energy of the area of interest will also be used as a 
        confirmation of the prediction of our model to help prevent false positives.
